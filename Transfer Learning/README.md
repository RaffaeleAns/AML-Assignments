In this repo you can find the [Python Notebook](https://github.com/RaffaeleAns/AML-Assignments/blob/master/TL/TL_Script.ipynb) and a brief [report](https://github.com/RaffaeleAns/AML-Assignments/blob/master/TL/TL_Report.pdf) written in Italian.

The task of the assignment is Transfer Learning using a CNN pretrained on IMAGENET.

The dataset, available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/slothkong/10-monkey-species), consists of 1300 images over 10 different monkeys species. 
The architecture used is VGG16.

The preprocessing operations include a Data Augmentation phase, in order to reduce the risk of overfitting.

The results of three specialized classification models, that uses VGG16 as feature extractor at different levels, are evaluated and compared.
