# 1. FeedForward Neural Network

The assignment consists in the prediction of default payments using a feed Forward Neural Network.

The dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005. 

After a brief Data Exploration, the classification problem has been solved.
Some preprocessing operations were needed to deal with unbalanced classes. 
2 models have been developed: the first baseline one has no care for the unbalanced classes, the second one uses weights in the training phase.

The results are evaluated and compared.
