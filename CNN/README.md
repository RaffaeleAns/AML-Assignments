In this repo you can find the [Python Notebook](https://github.com/RaffaeleAns/AML-Assignments/blob/master/CNN/CNN_Script.ipynb) and a brief [report](https://github.com/RaffaeleAns/AML-Assignments/blob/master/CNN/CNN_Report.pdf) written in Italian.

The task of the assignment is the design of a CNN architecture and its training overt the MNIST digits dataset.

After the classic preprossing operations, the Convolutional Neural Network has been designed with respect to the hard constraint of a maximum 7.5 k parameters. 
The CNN, its architecture and its performances have been widely discussed in the report.
